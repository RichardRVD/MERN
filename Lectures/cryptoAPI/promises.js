// imagine you have to be home to sign for a package that is going to be delivered at some point in time. 
// however, you have sereval other tasks to do: do homework, cook food, walk dogs.

// option A: Dont do anything and just wait for package, then do the tasks.
// option B: While waiting for the package, do as many tasks as you can, and then you sign off for package when doorbell rings and continue tasks.

// API (Application Programming Interface) calls are an example of Option B. 
// A promise is when you have some code that is running and while you're waiting for that the code to be executed/finish, you can tell program to read other lines of code instead of waiting for a request/response cycle.

// API is a source for some external data that you can use in your application.
